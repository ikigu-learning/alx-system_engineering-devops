# Bash Loops, Conditions and Parsing

In this repository, I solve the ALX problem set for Bash loops, conditions and parsing. The problem set was designed to test those concepts plus the following:

- `env`
- `cut`
- `for`
- `while`
- `until`
- `if`

## Learning Objectives

- How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements
- How to use the `cut` command
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them
