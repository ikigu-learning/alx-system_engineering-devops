# Postmortem

**Issue Summary**

Duration: The outage occurred from 2:00 AM to 6:30 AM UTC on June 5, 2024, which means our night owls and early birds had a rough morning.

Impact: Our e-commerce website experienced a case of the slowpokes, with intermittent downtime affecting approximately 75% of users. Customers were unable to browse products, add items to their cart, or complete purchases during the incident, leaving them as frustrated as a kid in a candy store with no money.

Root Cause: The issue was caused by a memory leak in the application server, which led to excessive memory consumption and eventually caused the server to crash. It's like trying to fit the entire library of Alexandria into a single book – sooner or later, something's gotta give.

**Timeline**

- `2:15 AM` - The monitoring system triggered an alert, letting us know our servers were working harder than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest.
- `2:30 AM` - An on-call engineer was notified and began investigating the issue, probably while still in their pajamas.
- `3:00 AM` - The engineering team suspected a possible memory leak in the application code and attempted to restart the server, which provided temporary relief, like a band-aid on a bullet wound.
- `3:45 AM` - The issue resurfaced, and the team started exploring alternative debugging paths, including checking for potential database issues or network bottlenecks, because sometimes the obvious answer isn't the right one.
- `4:30 AM` - After ruling out other potential causes, the team escalated the incident to the senior engineering manager and the operations team, bringing in the big guns.
- `5:15 AM` - The root cause was identified as a memory leak in a third-party library used by the application, proving that sometimes it's not us, it's them.
- `6:00 AM` - A temporary workaround was implemented by disabling the affected library and restarting the application server, like ripping off a Band-Aid – quick and painful.
- `6:30 AM` - The website was back online, and performance returned to normal, allowing customers to resume their virtual window shopping.

**Root Cause and Resolution**

The root cause of the issue was a memory leak in a third-party library used by the e-commerce application. This library was responsible for handling image resizing and optimization tasks, and it had a bit of a hoarding problem when it came to memory.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team initially disabled the affected library as a temporary workaround, like putting duct tape over a leaky pipe. This allowed the application server to restart and function properly, albeit without image resizing and optimization capabilities, which meant our product photos looked a little rough around the edges.

As a long-term solution, the team identified and implemented an updated version of the library that addressed the memory leak issue, kind of like getting a new plumber to fix the pipes properly. After thorough testing (because no one wants a repeat performance), the new version was deployed to the production environment, restoring full functionality while mitigating the risk of future memory-related issues.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

Areas for improvement:
- Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect memory leaks and resource exhaustion scenarios more effectively, so we can catch these issues before they become full-blown emergencies.
- Implement regular code reviews and performance testing to identify and address potential memory leaks or inefficient resource utilization early in the development cycle, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
- Establish a process for regular third-party library updates and security patch management, because even our dependencies need to stay up-to-date.

Specific tasks:
- Implement memory leak detection and alerting in the monitoring system, so we can stop these leaks before they become floods.
- Conduct a comprehensive code audit to identify potential memory leaks or inefficient resource usage patterns, because sometimes our own code is the culprit.
- Establish a process for regularly updating and testing third-party libraries and dependencies, to avoid getting caught off guard by their bugs.
- Enhance load testing and performance testing procedures to include memory leak and resource exhaustion scenarios, because we need to be prepared for the worst-case scenarios.
- Implement automated alerts for critical resource utilization thresholds (CPU, memory, disk space) on all production servers, so we can catch these issues before they become full-blown crises.
- Develop and document a thorough incident response plan for memory leak and resource exhaustion scenarios, because being prepared is half the battle.
