"""
Write a Python script that, using this REST API,
for a given employee ID, returns information
about his/her TODO list progress.

Requirements:

    - You must use urllib or requests module
    - The script must accept an integer as a parameter,
      which is the employee ID
    - The script must display on the standard
      output the employee TODO list progress in this exact format:
        - First line: Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with
        tasks(NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS/TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS):
            - EMPLOYEE_NAME: name of the employee
            - NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS: number of completed tasks
            - TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS: total number of tasks,
            which is the sum of completed and non-completed tasks
        - Second and N next lines display the title
          of completed tasks: TASK_TITLE
          (with 1 tabulation and 1 space before the TASK_TITLE)
